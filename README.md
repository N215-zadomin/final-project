For our final project, we were to re-create the Eventsy prototype we were given. The page had to be a dynamic website, and had to be done with jQuery and with the MVC model.
I hink the biggest challenge for me was getting the links that were not part of the navigation to work. I definitely overcomplicated it and it took moe way more time than it should have. In the end, I think it turned out pretty nice.
